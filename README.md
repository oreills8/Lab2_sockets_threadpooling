This code runs the socket for port 2500 which is set in the start.sh file, where it can be changed to any available port address.

The main file is Server.rb and start.sh. There is no compile.sh as there are no actions nessesary to prepare my service for execution. 

All the code is writen in ruby so there no other dependies needed for this system. 

There are three optional example clients that run and send "HELLO text" and client3 sends "KILL_SERVICE" and terminates the server. All these axamples run at a port of 2500 also.
